Review docs/plans/initial-mvp-overview.md for implementing the intial MVP for
this project. Enure the plan is decomposed into major phases that can be
implemented independently with clear testing and validation points. Each phase
should be completable in 1-2 days and have minimal dependencies on other phases.
Note that the Project Setup execution plan has already been completed.

If the plan is not sufficient, propose the changes neeeded to make it so and
create a spec for making changes to the plan.
